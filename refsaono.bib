abstract="Despite their popularity, lattice reduction algorithms remain mysterious cryptanalytical tools. Though it has been widely reported that they behave better than their proved worst-case theoretical bounds, no precise assessment has ever been given. Such an assessment would be very helpful to predict the behaviour of lattice-based attacks, as well as to select keysizes for lattice-based cryptosystems. The goal of this paper is to provide such an assessment, based on extensive experiments performed with the NTL library. The experiments suggest several conjectures on the worst case and the actual behaviour of lattice reduction algorithms. We believe the assessment might also help to design new reduction algorithms overcoming the limitations of current algorithms.",

abstract="Despite their popularity, lattice reduction algorithms remain mysterious in many ways. It has been widely reported that they behave much more nicely than what was expected from the worst-case proved bounds, both in terms of the running time and the output quality. In this article, we investigate this puzzling statement by trying to model the average case of lattice reduction algorithms, starting with the celebrated Lenstra-Lenstra-Lov{\'a}sz algorithm (L3). We discuss what is meant by lattice reduction on the average, and we present extensive experiments on the average case behavior of L3, in order to give a clearer picture of the differences/similarities between the average and worst cases. Our work is intended to clarify the practical behavior of L3 and to raise theoretical questions on its average behavior.",

abstract="We present a new and fast method, called the cross-entropy method, for finding the optimal solution of combinatorial and continuous nonconvex optimization problems with convex bounded domains. To find the optimal solution we solve a sequence of simple auxiliary smooth optimization problems based on Kullback-Leibler cross-entropy, importance sampling, Markov chain and Boltzmann distribution. We use importance sampling as an important ingredient for adaptive adjustment of the temperature in the Boltzmann distribution and use Kullback-Leibler cross-entropy to find the optimal solution. In fact, we use the mode of a unimodal importance sampling distribution, like the mode of beta distribution, as an estimate of the optimal solution for continuous optimization and Markov chains approach for combinatorial optimization. In the later case we show almost surely convergence of our algorithm to the optimal solution. Supporting numerical results for both continuous and combinatorial optimization problems are given as well. Our empirical studies suggest that the cross-entropy method has polynomial in the size of the problem running time complexity.",

abstract="The security of lattice-based cryptosystems such as NTRU, GGH and Ajtai-Dwork essentially relies upon the intractability of computing a shortest non-zero lattice vector and a closest lattice vector to a given target vector in high dimensions. The best algorithms for these tasks are due to Kannan, and, though remarkably simple, their complexity estimates have not been improved since over twenty years. Kannan's algorithm for solving the shortest vector problem (SVP) is in particular crucial in Schnorr's celebrated block reduction algorithm, on which rely the best known generic attacks against the lattice-based encryption schemes mentioned above. In this paper we improve the complexity upper-bounds of Kannan's algorithms. The analysis provides new insight on the practical cost of solving?SVP, and helps progressing towards providing meaningful key-sizes.",

abstract="The Lenstra-Lenstra-Lov{\'a}sz lattice basis reduction algorithm (LLL or L3) is a very popular tool in public-key cryptanalysis and in many other fields. Given an integer d-dimensional lattice basis with vectors of norm less than?B in an n-dimensional space, L3 outputs a so-called L3-reduced basis in polynomial time O(d                5                n log3                B), using arithmetic operations on integers of bit-length O(d log B). This worst-case complexity is problematic for lattices arising in cryptanalysis where d or/and log B are often large. As a result, the original L3 is almost never used in practice. Instead, one applies floating-point variants of L3, where the long-integer arithmetic required by Gram-Schmidt orthogonalisation (central in L3) is replaced by floating-point arithmetic. Unfortunately, this is known to be unstable in the worst-case: the usual floating-point L3 is not even guaranteed to terminate, and the output basis may not be L3-reduced at all. In this article, we introduce the L2?algorithm, a new and natural floating-point variant of L3 which provably outputs L3-reduced bases in polynomial time O(d                4                n (d + log B) log B). This is the first L3 algorithm whose running time (without fast integer arithmetic) provably grows only quadratically with respect to log B, like the well-known Euclidean and Gaussian algorithms, which it generalizes.",

Our resulting signature scheme is secure, in the random oracle model, based on the worst-case hardness of the {\~O}(n                1.5)-SIVP problem in general lattices. The secret key, public key, and the signature size of our scheme are smaller than in all previous instantiations of the hash-and-sign signature, and our signing algorithm is also quite simple, requiring just a few matrix-vector multiplications and rejection samplings. We then also show that by slightly changing the parameters, one can get even more efficient signatures that are based on the hardness of the Learning With Errors problem. Our construction naturally transfers to the ring setting, where the size of the public and secret keys can be significantly shrunk, which results in the most practical to-date provably secure signature scheme based on lattices.",

The main cryptographic application of our work is the proof that the Ajtai-Dwork ([2]) and the Regev ([33]) cryptosystems, which were previously only known to be based on the hardness of uSVP, can be equivalently based on the hardness of worst-case GapSVP                                                                          {\$}{\{}{\_}{\{}O({\{}n^{\{}2.5{\}}{\}}){\}}{\}}{\$}                 and GapSVP                                                                          {\$}{\{}{\_}{\{}O(n^{\{}2{\}}){\}}{\}}{\$}                , respectively.

abstract="At CRYPTO 2013, Boneh and Zhandry initiated the study of quantum-secure encryption. They proposed first indistinguishability definitions for the quantum world where the actual indistinguishability only holds for classical messages, and they provide arguments why it might be hard to achieve a stronger notion. In this work, we show that stronger notions are achievable, where the indistinguishability holds for quantum superpositions of messages. We investigate exhaustively the possibilities and subtle differences in defining such a quantum indistinguishability notion for symmetric-key encryption schemes. We justify our stronger definition by showing its equivalence to novel quantum semantic-security notions that we introduce. Furthermore, we show that our new security definitions cannot be achieved by a large class of ciphers -- those which are quasi-preserving the message length. On the other hand, we provide a secure construction based on quantum-resistant pseudorandom permutations; this construction can be used as a generic transformation for turning a large class of encryption schemes into quantum indistinguishable and hence quantum semantically secure ones. Moreover, our construction is the first completely classical encryption scheme shown to be secure against an even stronger notion of indistinguishability, which was previously known to be achievable only by using quantum messages and arbitrary quantum encryption circuits.",

In the paradigm we suggest, a practical protocol P is produced by first devising and proving correct a protocol PR for the random oracle model, and then replacing oracle accesses by the computation of an “appropriately chosen” function h. This paradigm yields protocols much more efficient than standard ones while retaining many of the advantages of provable security. We illustrate these gains for problems including encryption, signatures, and zero-knowledge proofs.},

abstract="The security of code-based cryptosystems such as the McEliece cryptosystem relies primarily on the difficulty of decoding random linear codes. The best decoding algorithms are all improvements of an old algorithm due to Prange: they are known under the name of information set decoding techniques. It is also important to assess the security of such cryptosystems against a quantum computer. This research thread started in [23] and the best algorithm to date has been Bernstein's quantising [5] of the simplest information set decoding algorithm, namely Prange's algorithm. It consists in applying Grover's quantum search to obtain a quadratic speed-up of Prange's algorithm. In this paper, we quantise other information set decoding algorithms by using quantum walk techniques which were devised for the subset-sum problem in [6]. This results in improving the worst-case complexity of {\$}{\$}2^{\{}0.06035n{\}}{\$}{\$}of Bernstein's algorithm to {\$}{\$}2^{\{}0.05869n{\}}{\$}{\$}with the best algorithm presented here (where n is the codelength).",

abstract="We present new candidates for quantum-resistant public-key cryptosystems based on the conjectured difficulty of finding isogenies between supersingular elliptic curves. The main technical idea in our scheme is that we transmit the images of torsion bases under the isogeny in order to allow the two parties to arrive at a common shared key despite the noncommutativity of the endomorphism ring. Our work is motivated by the recent development of a subexponential-time quantum algorithm for constructing isogenies between ordinary elliptic curves. In the supersingular case, by contrast, the fastest known quantum attack remains exponential, since the noncommutativity of the endomorphism ring means that the approach used in the ordinary case does not apply. We give a precise formulation of the necessary computational assumption along with a discussion of its validity. In addition, we present implementation results showing that our protocols are multiple orders of magnitude faster than previous isogeny-based cryptosystems over ordinary curves.",

The security of this implementation is proved under the interactability assumptin of deciding Quadratic Residuosity modulo composite numbers whose factorization is unknown."
