# What Every Quantum Scientist and Engineer Should Know about Cryptography

This repository contains some notes on cryptography originally
developed in the summer and fall of 2019, spurred by a query at a
[conference in Berlin](https://www3.math.tu-berlin.de/combi/dmg/TES-Summer2019/index.html)
that June.

The notes are also being put on [my
blog](https://rdvlivefromtokyo.blogspot.com/2019/10/what-every-quantum-researcher-and.html).

Comments and contributions very welcome!
